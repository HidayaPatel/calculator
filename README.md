## Project descrption 

This project does basic calculations with only twonumber inputs. We first ask the user to choose a calculation and then input two numbers.

1. Division by zero not possible in my vcode
  ``` python  
   time_vs_light = {}
    for row in data[1:]:
    total_time = float(row[3])
    light = row[5]
    if light in time_vs_light:
        time_vs_light[light].append(total_time)
    else:
        time_vs_light[light] = [total_time]

   ```
3. multiple number inputs is not possible
4. Would love to add additional calculations
